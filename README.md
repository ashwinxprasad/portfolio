# Portfolio App
This is my portfolio app, inspired by fellow GitHub user Gage. His repository was in a pretty bad shape when I came across it. I hence decided to make a copy and modify it instead of forking it. However, feel free to fork this and use to your benefit.
The app is hosted on [ashwinxprasad.xyz](https://ashwinxprasad.xyz) 
I used `gh-pages` to deploy the app into this repository's `gh-pages` branch

## Setup

- Install Dependencies:  `npm install`

## Develop

* Run local server - `npm start`


## Deploy

* Change the `package.json` to meet your needs. Be sure to change `homepage:` to reflect your custom domain
* Deploy *only* the React App: `npm run deploy`
