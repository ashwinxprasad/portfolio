      Gatorstep is a quality flooring manufacturer. I was tasked with creating a 
      3d product viewer, allowing users to see the different color combinations,
      patterns, textures - All on a 3d boat model.
    
      <br /><br />

      This was my first time working with <a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>,
      and 3d-models on-the-web. Needless to say, it was a very educational experience.

      <br /><br />

      The biggest hurdle in this project was definitely prepping the 3d-models in a
      way that would work well with ThreeJS. There was a lot of trial and error,
      testing, and breaking everything - But eventually I found a reliable pipeline.

      The Canby Educational Foundation is an organization that supplies
      grants to local schools. Their previous website was built with React,
      using a custom-made CMS, everything worked fine but it wasn't quite
      as flexible as they wanted - So I was tasked with recreating the site
      from scratch in Wordpress.
      
      <br /><br />

      This project was a lot of fun. I used the
      <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">
      Advanced Custom Fields</a> plugin which allowed me to easily make nearly 
      any element on the site customizable for the client. There is also a 
      <a href="https://canbyedfoundation.org/grant-form/">grant application
      form</a> on the site. Which, in making it, helped me learn a lot about
      Wordpress & SMTP.

      Yes! I am talking about this site. Working on it has been a ton of fun
      and I've learned a lot. Most of my time working on this site has been
      spent designing and making sure everything feels right.

      <br /><br />

      This site is a React app - I decided to use React because I knew I wanted
      it to have that single-page-application feel - And it is a technology that
      I am constantly trying to improve with.

      <br /><br />
      
      Overall the biggest takeaway from my time spent working on this site has to be
      my newfound backend knowledge. I set up this static site to be served with
      NGINX, and the API used to send emails from the contact form is being ran by
      Docker.
